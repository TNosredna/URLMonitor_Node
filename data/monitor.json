My name is Melly. I'm a 6-month old spayed female Havanese mix. I weigh about 8 pounds right now, but I'll probably put on a few more before I'm done growing. I don't mean to brag, but my friends tell me I'm the cutest little ball of fluff they've ever seen! Do you agree? I sure hope so! I'm not just a pretty face though, I'm also super sweet and affectionate. I'm the whole package!<br><br>You'd never know it from my happy demeanor, but I've endured a lot more pain than a dog my age deserves. Here's my story. I don't remember exactly what happened, but I somehow ended up with a huge open wound on my neck. To treat the wound, my family applied a topical medication, covered it with a sock, and dropped me off at the pound. Is that how you take care of a family member?! I didn't think so either. By the way, the medication that was applied is called Gentian Violet, which explains the purple spots on my fur. I didn't want you to think I spend all my time at the salon! I have more important things to do, like play with my doggy friends and snuggle with the human ones. I get along with everyone!<br><br>Upon closer examination, the shelter vet determined that I would need surgery to repair the wound on my neck. Unfortunately, the city shelters don't have the resources to pay for this type of surgery, but luckily, CageFree came to my rescue! They brought me to their personal vet for surgery and back to their facility to rest. I had to be isolated for a couple of weeks in order for my neck to heal properly, which was brutal! Being a puppy, I was itching to run around and play!<br><br>Now I'm all better and I'm having a great time with my new friends. I couldn't be happier! Well, actually, there is one thing that would make my life even better, and that's a forever home. Since I'm still a puppy, my ideal family would be active, fun-loving and adventurous. I'm looking for a family that likes to cuddle, enjoys doggy kisses and most importantly, will love me unconditionally.<br><br>So, what do you say? Do I sound like the pup you've been looking for?

She just had her babies two months ago – right before she got dumped at the shelter and separated from her sister.  She’s had a stressful couple of months.  Despite this she is a gentle, loving soul who minds well and is affectionate.  She doesn’t know all the basic commands but she is smart and it is only a matter of time.  She walks well on the leash and has no problems with cats or dogs.  She is housebroken and crate trained.  She sleeps through the night.  She was a little stressed and fearful coming into her new temporary foster home and we can expect that she may go through this again if moved to a new home. However, she adjusts well and as soon as she is settled in her sweet, loving nature comes out and she turns into a perfectly well behaved little cuddlebug.  Gracie is a low maintenance little girl would make a wonderful companion for a Senior or first time dog owner as she’s so easy and willing to please.  She could gain a few pounds after all she’s been through. Wouldn’t you just love to spoil her?<br><br>IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS DOG, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE READ THE DOG'S INFORMATION CAREFULLY.
